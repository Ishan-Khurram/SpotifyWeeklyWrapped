What weekly wrapped does:


Gets most recently listened to song
    track all spotify data in one class - spotipy api

plugs it into excel sheet that records
	artist
	album
	song
	genre of song
	album art
	song duration
	when it was listened

	    There should be 3 pages within the google sheet.
	        one that tracks all time stats
	        one that tracks week by week, data older than a week is deleted from this sheet, but kept in the all time
	        sheet that tracks only the genre listened to, so that email can give recommendations based off of genre pref that week

	    use sheety api, make its own class.


Excel sheet should then calculate total amount of minutes music was listened to that week.

get top 5 songs listened to that week

send email every monday about top 5 songs, and reccomend playlist based on recent listening

                                                           Steps to take to complete goal:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. create class that handles all spotipy api requests.
    a. Get recently listened to track
    b. get the 	artist
	            album
                song
                genre of song
                album art
                song duration
                when it was listened

2. create class that handles all Sheety api requests.
    a. plug all the data mentioned above into its individual cells

3. Using google sheets, automate email that holds all of the above data and send it to yourself every monday.
    the reccomended playlist should have 30-50 songs ideally.


                                                           Things i have thought to change:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right now, all the metrics i want are within the print method in track_songs.py.

Create methods to grab each individual piece of data instead of mass printing it in one method
to allow for easier plugins with SHEETY.
